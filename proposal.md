See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

This is a program that helps people search their mutual friends by just enter names of themselves and their friends, and
this program would list all their mutual friends' names and number of mutual friends they have. 

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)
Find your mutual FRIENDS!!!


2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.

(eg.) 1.Bob 2.Sponge Bob 3.Gary (You have 3 mutual friends)

3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.

Input the PersonA:(user input string (eg. "Zhiyue"))

Input the PersonB:(user input string (eg. "Russell"))

Input the ...(input could be more than 2 people):(user input string (eg. "Jikai"))

4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.
simple graphic user interface: just enter the names, and it will print out our mutual friends' names.


5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.

**People.java:** has name, friends' names

Main.java 

comprehensive testing of People unit

Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.

Use GUI as our interface (See figure 1)

Main.java is where the program get input and output

People is a type that stores information of each person.**
