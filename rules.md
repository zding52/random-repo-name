# X-Team 22 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Weekly meeting on Thursday: talk about how to assign tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Meet with each other every Thursday, or at least meet 2 days before due days.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Throgh text. Text in group when they are done with a method. 
If member could not finish the method assigned within 2 days, he or she should text within group.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Remind each other in the text group and update progress every three days and two days before deadline.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Let at least two people look at your code and agree before push to git.
